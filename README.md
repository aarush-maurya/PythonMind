# 🧠 PythonMind

Welcome to **PythonMind** — a second-brain–style, Obsidian-powered knowledge system for learning **Python**, built entirely using markdown and internal link structures (`[[x]]`) to create a deeply connected mental map of core programming concepts.

## 📚 What is This?

**PythonMind** is:
- A modular, organized vault of Python concepts, examples, and explanations.
- Written in native **Obsidian Markdown**, using:
  - `#` Headings
  - `**bold**` and `` `inline code` ``
  - ```python code blocks```
  - `[[internal links]]` to create a rich, navigable network of notes
- Designed for:
  - Beginners building foundational understanding
  - Intermediates revising interconnected ideas
  - Anyone creating a personal dev knowledge base

## 🧩 Structure

Each `.md` file represents **one Python topic** (e.g. `[[for loops]]`, `[[functions]]`, `[[casting]]`).  
Files include:
- ✅ Definitions
- ✅ Features / Use-Cases
- ✅ Syntax-highlighted Python examples
- ✅ Related `[[internal links]]` to other concepts
- ✅ Tips, gotchas, and clarity-first notes

This creates a **contextual graph** of Python knowledge — fast to reference, easy to expand.

## 🔗 Example Topics

```txt
📄 def.md            → Function definitions
📄 return.md         → How return works
📄 for loops.md      → Iteration using for
📄 data types.md     → Overview of all built-in types
📄 string operation.md → Indexing, slicing, and manipulation
```

Internal links like `[[if]]`, `[[input]]`, or `[[mutability]]` will guide you through the entire Python ecosystem.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo or download the vault.
2. Open it in **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** (recommended).
3. Browse via the file explorer, or start with the **graph view** for a high-level map.
4. Click `[[links]]` to explore concepts in-depth and interconnected context.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This vault is under active construction. Not all internal links have full content yet — but they are **intentional placeholders** for a growing second-brain.
